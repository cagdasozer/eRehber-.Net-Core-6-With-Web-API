<h3> 
 üåü Project Description
In this project, it is aimed to create a simple phone book application by designing a structure with web services to be used by web or mobile applications. In this project, it was written considering the layered architectural structure and SOLID principles. Added FluentValidation support for Validation and Autofac support for IoC. You can download the project to your computer and run it after "migration". <br>
</h3> 
 
‚û°Ô∏è ASP.Net Web API is used. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è ASP.NET Core 6 is used. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è Core First approach is adopted and Fluent API is used. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è It was prepared by asynchronous methods. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è Aspect Oriented Programming infrastructure has been prepared over the Autofac library. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è Dependency solver infrastructure is prepared on the backend side via Autofac Library. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è Verification infrastructure has been prepared over the Fluent Validation Library. <br>
‚û°Ô∏è The endpoint infrastructure has been prepared for the responses of requests to the API. <br>
